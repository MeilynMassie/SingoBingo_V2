PSYCOPG2 NUANCES
- Single params in DB have to have trailing comma. Python will interpert as an int 
  instead of tuple which is needed to run in db 


MAKEFILE NOTES
- .PHONY: In case the command is the name of a file
- &: Runs the next line immediately instead of waiting for it to close
- Doesn't run in venvs so you have to specify in the command


FOR TESTING LOCALLY WIHTOUT RUNNING FLASK 
- Run > make test
- Use keyword "assert" to return more detailed errors or use pytest
